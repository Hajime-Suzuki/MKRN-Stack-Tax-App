# Tax App

---

### Simple tax app with MKRN(Mongo, Koa, React, Node) stack.

Redux structure is based on the "[Redux Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)" style.

#### Motivation

As a freelancer, it is annoying to keep track on expense, income, who paid or not, and so forth. An Excel file is a simple solution, but it doesn't look nice...right? I would like to make a nice and simple app for my tax declaration.
